# Next.js starter kit
Learn to build amazing apps with Next.js, GraphQL, Storybook, Typescript, Styled-Components and Framer motion. Everything is included in this single repo.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

Run the storybook server:

```bash
npm run storybbok
# or
yarn storybbok
```

Open [http://localhost:6006](http://localhost:6006) with your browser to see the result.

## About The Stack

### Next.js
Next.js is a flexible React framework that gives you building blocks to create fast web applications.

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

### GraphQL
GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data. 
GraphQL provides a complete and understandable description of the data in your API, gives clients the 
power to ask for exactly what they need and nothing more, makes it easier to evolve APIs over time, and 
enables powerful developer tools.

- [GraphQL Documentation](https://graphql.org/code/#javascript) - learn about GraphQL features and API.
- [Learn GraphQL](https://graphql.org/learn/) - GraphQL tutorials.

### Storybook
Storybook is a tool for UI development. It makes development faster and easier by isolating components. 
This allows you to work on one component at a time. You can develop entire UIs without needing to start 
up a complex dev stack, force certain data into your database, or navigate around your application.

- [Storybook Documentation](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/get-started/introduction) - learn about Storybook features and API.
- [Learn Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/tutorials/) - learn Storybook.

### Styled-Components
Utilising tagged template literals (a recent addition to JavaScript) and the power of CSS, 
styled-components allows you to write actual CSS code to style your components. It also 
removes the mapping between components and styles â€“ using components as a low-level styling 
construct could not be easier!
- [Styled-Components Documentation](https://styled-components.com/docs) - learn Styled-Components.

### Framer Motion
A production-ready motion library for React. Utilize the power behind Framer, the best prototyping tool for teams. 
Proudly open source. Production-ready declarative animations. A simple declarative syntax means you write less 
code. Less code means your codebase is easier to read and maintain.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
